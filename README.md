# PlayAndLearn
A project where education is fun.

EdTech has been developing since 1950's with sci-fi books and even an with [The Jetsons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyinD6ZDqeg) but rarely got a break into the market. This would an exercise on what makes a good interactive learning experience and what it takes to do it. 

**MVP**: Our project will encompass many random aspects of what "learning" might mean in the web space, ranging from
simple quizzes to gamefied learning experiences such as flash cards and hangman, which would include all what we have learned during this course.

## **Group B** Team Members: Ahmad Alhirthani, Daoud Nazek, Rania Qatawneh, Roukia Salahi and Yahya Abu Khalil.
